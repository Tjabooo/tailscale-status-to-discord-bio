# NOTE:
This no longer works and it's a problem on Discord's end so I will just leave it. Can't be bothered :p 

A script that fetches the system status of your selected Tailscale connected devices, and then changes their respective status in your Discord bio. Pretty much.

Made for educational purposes.
I have not engaged in the breaking of Discord's Terms of Service by utilizing this script for my own personal account.
